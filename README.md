# TinyML-Split-Model-learning-ESP32-S3
In this work, we examine the potential of implementing SL
machine learning approach in resource-constrained environ-
ment, enabling on-device distribution of the ML computational
load. For running ML models on hardware with limited
resources, we opted for the TinyML framework solution.
